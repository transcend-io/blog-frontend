# Make a frontend blog

This is an example website for our blog on making frontends in AWS with terraform + github actions

## Lambda@Edge

As an example of how extensible terraform modules can be, this repo also includes an example of using a Lambda@Edge function to add security headers to the site.

The code for the function is found under `src/security_headers`.
